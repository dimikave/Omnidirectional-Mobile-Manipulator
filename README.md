# Robotics

This is a repo for my robotics projects. For now it contains the project done during the Robotics Class - Summer semester of 2021 in Aristotle University of Thessaloniki.

## Omnidirectional Mobile Manipulator
As a semester project, the simulation of a omnidirectional mobile platform with a 6-DOF manipulator in a pick and place task was implemented. The simulation runs in MATLAB 3D environment and is is presented in the following GIFs:

Implementation of trajectory planning in the Cartesian Space with via points (implemented as 1 distinct trajectory planning per couple of via points)

Implementation of trajectory planning in the Joint Space with via points (implemented as 1 continuous trajectory)

## Status
This is a repo that I aspire to maintain and update frequently.
