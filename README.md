# Robotics

This is a repo for my robotics projects. For now it contains the project done during the Robotics Class - Summer semester of 2021 in Aristotle University of Thessaloniki.

## Omnidirectional Mobile Manipulator
As a semester project, the simulation of a omnidirectional mobile platform with a 6-DOF manipulator in a pick and place task was implemented. The simulation runs in MATLAB 3D environment and is is presented in the following GIF:
